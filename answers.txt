1. An RDBMS is a Relational Database Management System, which is a software that allows you to create and alter databases. SQL is not the system, but the language with which you write these queries and alterations.

2. A primary key allows you to note distinct pieces of data

3. Foreign Key?

4. A third table! (at least)
